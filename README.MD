Project Process of being Build

The choice of where to start the development process depends on various factors, including the complexity of your project, your team's expertise, and any specific requirements or preferences you have. However, here's a general guideline you can follow:

1. Start with User Management and Authentication:

Since user management is a fundamental aspect of your internship management software, it's a good idea to start by implementing user authentication and basic user management functionalities.
Begin by setting up user registration, login, and password reset functionalities. This forms the foundation for user access control throughout your application.
Once user authentication is in place, you can gradually expand on this foundation to include more advanced user management features, such as role-based access control and profile management.

2. Develop the Admin Panel:

Once basic user management functionalities are implemented, focus on building the admin panel. This will allow administrators to manage user accounts, configure system settings, and perform other administrative tasks.
Start with designing the user interface (UI) for the admin panel, considering the various functionalities administrators will need.
Implement the backend logic for handling administrative actions, such as adding/editing users, assigning roles and permissions, and configuring system settings.
Test the admin panel thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements and is user-friendly for administrators.

3. Proceed with Intern-Supervisor Communication and Update Submission:

With user management and the admin panel in place, you can then move on to implementing the communication platform between interns and supervisors.
Develop the messaging system that allows interns and supervisors to communicate, share updates, and provide feedback.
Integrate features for interns to submit updates (such as logbook images) to supervisors for grading, and for supervisors to review and provide feedback on these updates.
Starting with user authentication and management provides a solid foundation for your application, while building the admin panel early on allows you to streamline administrative tasks and configure the system according to your requirements. Once these core components are in place, you can progressively add more features and functionalities to complete your internship management software.
